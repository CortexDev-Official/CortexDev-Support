Extreme FPS optimization and universal server support, by CortexDev. Play smooth, connect anywhere


**VortexCraft**: Simple, Fast, and Optimized

I built **VortexCraft** because I wanted a modpack that just works. No **bloat**, no **unnecessary mods**—just pure **performance and the best FPS possible for your machine.**

What you get:

1. **Maximum FPS**: Uses the latest optimization mods like **Sodium** and **Lithium** to keep things smooth

2. **Play Anywhere**: Connect to almost **any server version** without switching packs

3. B**etter Stability**: Every mod is picked to ensure your game doesn't crash during sessions

4. **Lightweight**: Delivered as a **.mrpack** for a quick and **easy** setup

Calvin's Survival Experience

Ever watched **Calvin** and wished you could play exactly like him? Well, **now you can!** I put this modpack together to bring you the **same vibe**, (almost) the **same mods**, and that same intense atmosphere you see in his **videos**. It’s all set up and ready to go—just jump in and see if you can survive as long as he does.

Note!: I have no collaboration with **YouTuber Calvin**; this Modpack is fan-made.
