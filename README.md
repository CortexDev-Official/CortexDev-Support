# VortexCraft 
Link: ( https://modrinth.com/modpack/vortexcraft )

Extreme FPS optimization and universal server support, by CortexDev. Play smooth, connect anywhere

VortexCraft: Simple, Fast, and Optimized

I built VortexCraft because I wanted a modpack that just works. No bloat, no unnecessary mods—just pure performance and the best FPS possible for your machine.

What you get:

1. Maximum FPS: Uses the latest optimization mods like Sodium and Lithium to keep things smooth

2. Play Anywhere: Connect to almost any server version without switching packs

3. Better Stability: Every mod is picked to ensure your game doesn't crash during sessions

4. Lightweight: Delivered as a .mrpack for a quick and easy setup

   And Much More...

# Calvin's Survival Experience

Calvin's Survival Experience

Ever watched Calvin and wished you could play exactly like him? Well, now you can! I put this modpack together to bring you the same vibe, (almost) the same mods, and that same intense atmosphere you see in his videos. It’s all set up and ready to go—just jump in and see if you can survive as long as he does.

Note!: I have no collaboration with YouTuber Calvin; this Modpack is fan-made.
