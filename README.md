VortexCraft: Simple, Fast, and Optimized

I built VortexCraft because I wanted a modpack that just works. No bloat, no unnecessary mods—just pure performance and the best FPS possible for your machine.

What you get:

    Maximum FPS: Uses the latest optimization mods like Sodium and Lithium to keep things smooth

    Play Anywhere: Connect to almost any server version without switching packs

    Better Stability: Every mod is picked to ensure your game doesn't crash during sessions

    Lightweight: Delivered as a .mrpack for a quick and easy setup

    And Much More...
